when u need to process data, save to database

create the restaurant kitchen that:
    recieves requests from backend
    processes them (create post, like photo, follow user)
    talks to database
    sends response back

tools u use:
    next.js api routes: easiest (built into next.js)
    express.js : traditional node.js server
    serverless functions: individual cloud functions

api endpoints
    /api/posts ===> get all posts
    /api/posts/create ====? create new posts
    /api/posts/like ------> like a post
    /api/users/follow ----> follow someone
