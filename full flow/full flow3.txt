frontend ui

websites finally stop being ugly

    bootstrap
    css3
    media queries
    icon fonts

build layout quickly
makes sites look consistent
design once and work on mobile
use prebuild buttons, navbars, and cards


frontend logic

js grows up and becomes useful

jquery makes everything easy
backbone / angularjs invent structured frontend apps
requirejs, browsify allow js modules
ajax becomes one line on code

    become updates
    fetch data without reload
    complex ui state
    animations
    app like interactions



navigation / routing 

tools like:
    backbone router
    angular js router
    HTML 5 history api
    hash url

switch pages instantly
avoid reload
feel like apps

state management

for the first time, frontend has too much state

    js variables
    jquery plugins
    angularjs two way binding
    cookies

    MVC (Backbone)
    service based state
