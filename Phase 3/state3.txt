think gmail, fb, x, maps


suddently the browser had to 
    update the parts of the page without reload
    handle dozens of buttons, inputs, popups
    remember lots of data
    stay resposnive
    fetch more data without refreshing
    show instant UI changes

the small tricks from PHASE 2 werent enough 
so developers tried eveything everywhere


JS Variables

temp memory
    great until page relaods, then bye bye

    useful for small stuff like
        ui flags
        temporary selections



jQuery Plugin

every jQuery plugin stored state in random places

ui + state got mized like noodles in soup
every button click could break something



AngularJS 2-way binding

change input -> UI updates
change UI -> data updates

cool... but it become chaotic

    too many watches
    too many automatic updates
    performance died
    debugging was nightware fuel
