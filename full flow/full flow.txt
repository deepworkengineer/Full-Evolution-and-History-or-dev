frontend ui 
    no color, layout, styles, fonts

frontend logic
    the page could not think. At all
no buttons that do stuff
no popups
no animations 
no validation
you click a link, and that's this only "interaction" possible
a 1990 webpage is basically a PDF someone glued into a browser

navigation 
    u had one magical tool
click -> entire page reloads from scratch
there was no:
    SPA
    partial update
    router
    transitions
    dynamic navigation
it felt the flipping images in a book


state management 

the browser remembered nothing
reload === brain wipe
switch page === brain wipe

there was NO:
    cookie
    session
    token
    javascript memory
    localstorage
    saving data

every click was a complete reset
its like meeting someone new for the first time every 3 seconds


data flow

the entire flow was this masterpiece
browser: yo server, give me index.html
server: here, take it 
that it



backend logic

doesnt exist 
servers were vending machines, put in a request --> get a file


auth

no


servers

the first gen of web servers did exactly one thing
    look at your url
    find the matching file
    send it back as -is

no routing logic
no middleware
no backend calculation



hosting / deployments

u open a FTP connection to a UNIX machine
    ftp myserver.com
    put index.html

your site is "live"
just dump files on a server and hope they load



API

no



dev tooling

typed HTML
