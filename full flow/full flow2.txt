frontend ui (how websites look)

web finally started looking decent instead of just plain text on white page

the story:
    before this, website were basically just text documents
    now with HTML 3 and 4, you could add structure --- heading, paragraphs, lists
    CSS arrived in 1996 and was revolutionary --- suddenly u could change colors, fonts, spacing without Mixing it into HTML
    designers used tables to create layouts -- they'd nest invisible tables to position things. It was messy but it worked
    add images (png, jpeg)
    header, sidebar, main content, footer





frontend logic (making pages interactive)

pages could now respond to what u did without asking the server
before js, u forgot to fill in a form field, u click submit wait for the page to reload, then see an error message
now js, could check ur form BEFORE submitting -- hey, u forgot your email
u could click a button and see a dropdown menu appear
you could hover over something and see it change color
pop up window become possible

the dom -- it let js see and change any part of the webpage, 






navigation 


still mostly pages reloading

navigation works like this:
    u click a link
    browser loads a new page from server
    entire screen refreshes

1. PHP / ASP routes generate pages dynamically
2. people experiment with #navigation
3. no real SPA yet
4. in 2004, AJAX finally gave partial updates (baby SPA)




State Management 

the web starts remeebring things

before this, the web had memory of the goldfish

now we get,
    cookies
    backend sessions 
    hidden fields inside forms
    js variables for quick page level memory

this makes possible
    login
    shopping carts
    remember me
    saving form data
    user preferences
the web finally has short term and long term memory



data flow 

two kinds of data flows emerge

    a) full page reload 

    user ---> server ---> database ---> server ---> HTML ---> reload
    every action = new page


    b) ajax (2004)
    the big invention

    browser can ask quietly
    GET / api/products

    without refreshing the screen

    the first true web app experience begins

    data formats
        HTML chunks
        XML
        JSON 
    this is how gmail 2004 felt so fast




6. BACKEND LOGIC 

the server grows a brain

technologies
    PHP
    ASP
    JSP / Servers
    Perl CGI still early

Serverss can now:
    generate HTML dynamically
    process forms
    check passwords
    talk to database
    manage sessions
    render pages based on data

instead of sending static files servers compute and respond




7. DATABASE

the web becomes persistent

database join the gamel
    mysql
    postgresql
    oracle
    sql server
now u can store
    users
    posts
    comments
    product inventory
    orders
    sessions
this is the birth of 
    blogs
    forums
    e commerce
    early social network


auth

    user enters email/password
    servers checks in db
    servers creates a sessions
    server gives browser a cookie with session id
    browser sends cookie every time
    server knows who u r

no JWT
no OAUTH
no magic
just sessions in a db




servers

    servers become capable instead of dumb
        apache
        iis
        tomcat

    what servers now do
        run backend code (PHP, ASP, JSP)
        maintain sessions
        handle cookies
        manage file uploads
        serve static files
        schedule tasks (cron jobs)



API     

    api exists but uglier than your worst nightmare

    XML
    SOAP (Painful)
    early REST
    JSON is around but barely used

    API Support
        product listing
        payments
        shipping
        third party integration
        desktop mobile app 




DevTooling

    tools finally show up

    dreamweaver 
    frontpage
    phpMyAdmin
    early IDE
    FTP clients
    SVN / CVS
