apis appear but they are painful to use

    websites start giving data, not just pages
    but the data came in XML which is big and annoying
    companies also used SOAP, wehich is XML but even heavier
    JSON is invented, but not popular yet

think of it like takingn to someone who uses 10 extra words for everything
they answer your question, but in the worst way
