API becomes smart, fast, typed and real time

new types of APIs appear:
    GraphQL: ask only for the exact data u need
    gRPC: super fast binary communication
    tRPC: automatic typescript types across client / server
    Websockets: real time messages(chat / notifications)
    Edge Functions: API run close to the user for speed

modern API also have
    type safety
    global deployment
    caching
    real time streams
    monitoring
    API gateway
    AI focused endpoints

think of it taking to a personal assistant who already knows what format u want, answeres, instantly and stays updated in real time
