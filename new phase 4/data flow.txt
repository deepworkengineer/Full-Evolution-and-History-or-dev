when u need read data 

fetch posts from database
show loading spinner while fetching
display real posts when they arrive


    fetch api = get data from server
    axios = better fetch
    react query = smart data fetching (caches, auto refreshes)
    graphql = ask for exactly the data u need


user open apps:
    --- app asks server: "Give me posts"
    --- server sends posts
    --- app shows posts
