stone age --- links reload the whole page

cool, i'll throw the entire screen away and draw a new one

that it 
no tricks
no spa s
no nothing


slightly less stone age

still the same basic idea
    every link = full page reload
    server creates new HTML each time (PHP, ASP, JSP)
    you click "profile" --> Server literally sends profile.php

people tried weird JS hacks with #page1
but honestly ... still caveman routing
