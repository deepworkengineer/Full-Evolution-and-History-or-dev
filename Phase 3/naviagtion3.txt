this is when navigation stops being painful

early years: still servers routing (PHP, rails)
later years: client side routers are born

    backbone router
    angular js router
    hash routing: /#/profile
    then HTML5 history API

now you can click around without reload
everything feels like a baby app

SPAs show up and say
hey server, i ll handle navigation from now on
