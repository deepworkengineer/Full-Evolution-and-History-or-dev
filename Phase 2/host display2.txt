shared hosting. 300 people living in the same 1BHK

cheap hosting companies gave everyone a tiny folder an a giant linux machine
u used cPanel and FTP clients like FileZilla to drag files into public_html

deployment steps looked like:
    drag file
    hope it works
    see white screen
    panic
    drag old file back
    suffer loudly

no logs
no rollbacks
no safely
just a bunch of PHP files lives dangerously
