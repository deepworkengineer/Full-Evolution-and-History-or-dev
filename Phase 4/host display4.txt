deployment becomes magicaly and global

this is the vercel / netlify era

you push to Git, the platform

    builds the app
    deployes globally
    gives instant preview URL
    sets up HTTPS
    auto scales functions
    rolls back in seconds
    manages env vars
    distributes static files to 20 + regions


u iterally do nothing

no servers
no ssh
no config nigthmares
just git push.

everything else is handles behind your back (in a good way, suprisingly)
