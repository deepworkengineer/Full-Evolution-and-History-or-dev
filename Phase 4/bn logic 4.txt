backends turn into cloud monsters

everything goes global, fast, distributed and way too over engineered

new toys:
    microservices
    serverless functions
    distributed event systems
    container + kubernetes
    typed APIs
    Edge computing
    Real time everything
    AI integrations

everything auto scales, self heals, deploys everywhere, and runs magic at the edge of the internet

why one backend when u can have 200 tiny ones screaming in the cloud
