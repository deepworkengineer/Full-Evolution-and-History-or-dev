developers get tools, but the tools are clumsy and annoying
this era gave u some flashy apps that looked helpful but were secretly troublemakers

    dreamweaver let you drag and drap UI
    FrontPage tried to auto generate HTML
    phpMyAdmin gave you a visual database interface
    Early IDEs like VS CODE, existed but were heavy

    and version control?
    SVN and CVS felt like they were designed by someoen who heated devs

    everything kind of worked, but everything also broke easily

    deployment were literally
    open filezilla ---> drag files to server ----> pray
