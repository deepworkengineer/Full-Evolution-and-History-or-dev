thoughout development -- how frontend and backend talk

define HOW your frontend and backend communicate
    what url to call?
    what data format?
    what can you ask for?

tools you use:
    REST API: traditional (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    graphQL: ask for exactly what you need
    tRPC: Typescript end to end type safety

what u create:
    GET /api/posts = returns all posts
    POST /api/posts = creates new posts
    GET /api/users/123 = returns user 123
