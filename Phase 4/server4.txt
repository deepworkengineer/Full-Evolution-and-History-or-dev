server = not one machine anymore, a cloud creature


you dont manage a server
you manage  container, clusters, and functions



key powers:
    docker: pack you app so it runs anywhere
    kubernetes: run many containers on many machines
    serverless: run code without owning any servers
    edge compute: run code close to users
    auto scaling: more machines when traffic increases
    self healing: restart when something dies

this isnta computer
its a global swarm doing your thinking
