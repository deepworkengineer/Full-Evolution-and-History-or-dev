the browser grows muscles. JS takes over the world
the web stops being a collection of documetns
and becomes software running inside the browser

this is the era where:
    AJAX becomes default
    JSON replaces XML
    REST becomes the standard API pattern
    SPA appear 
    JQUERY BEcoems the unofficial governer of hte internet

Data Flow of Phases 3

Browser SPA --> JSON API ----> SErver logic ----> database
the browser runs the UI LOGIC
The server becomes a pure data machine

think:
    gmail 2010
    facebook 2012
    twitter 2014
    pinterest, linkedin, trello, early


Technologies that defined this era
