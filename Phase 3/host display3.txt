the cloud grows up. Deployment stops being a torture device.
two big inventions saved humanity from FTP misery

1. AWS EC2 (2006)
u can spin up a virtual linux server with one click

2. Heroku (2007)
u can deploy just by running git push

suddenly we have:
    GIT BASED deployments
    build pipelines
    logs
    environment variables
    staging servers
    CI/CD tools like jenkins


deployemnt becomes:
    commit
    push
    ci builds
    servers restarts properly

not glamourous, but at least u dont accidentally nuke your site by dragging a wrong file
