frontend ui

web pages turn into lego blocks
this era finally throws the old HTML files everywhere style
    react becomes the default
    vue spikes in popularity
    svelte introduced complier based ui
    tailwind gives utility classes
    design system 

    build ui ===== componenets (not random HTML, mashed together)
    a button === a component
    a card ===== a component
    a navbar === a component
    everything is reuseable and consistent


frontend logic

js becomes a real engineering lang

by now js isnt that messy kid from the 90s
its powerful typed reactive and running everywhere

    react hooks --> simple logic
    vue composition api ---> structured logic
    svelte ---> automatic reactivity
    servive workers ---> offline apps
    web workers ----> background processing





nav 

routing gets smarter than most humans

click --> page relods

    next.js file-based routes
    react router
    remix server first routing
    nested routes
    prefetching
    instant transitions

some routes load on the server
some load on the client
some load on the edge

the web finally gets app like navigation




state managment

state finaly stops being nightmare

early era gave us Redux choas
later era gives new solution

    zustand
    recoil
    jotai
    xstate
    react query  / swr for server state
    signals 

let the backend store the truth
frontend only caches and syncs




data flow

data stop being a simple request and becomes full pipeline

    graphql
    grpc
    trpc
    streaming apis
    edge api
    server components
    react query / swr
    apollo relay

data now moves through a chain
    browser
    server
    edge locations
    global database
    caches
    event streamsn




backend logic

backend evolve into cloud native machines
    express / fastify / nestjs
    go fw
    python fast api
    rust web servers
    next.js server functions
    serverless functions (lambda)


architectures
    microservices
    event driven system
    message queries
    serverless compute
    distributed cron
    edge rendering

bn stop being one machine ---> becomes independent services working together



db


sql get superpowers
    postgre becomes king
    planent scale = serverless mysql
    neon = serverless postgre
    supabase = postgre + realtime

no sql 
    mongodb atlas
    firestore



auth

    login becomes outsourced and polished
    logins used to be:
        write code in PHP that checks password
            oauth
            jwt tokens
            magic links
            passkey / webauthn
            auth providers like auth0, clerk, firebase


servers

    servers tuen into cloud creatures
    servers stop being a single machines in a data centers

        docket for packaging
        kubernetes for orchestration
        serverless function for instant compute
        edge compute for global speed
        auto scaling
        automatic healing
        load balancing
        traffic routing


hosting / deployment 

    vercel
    render
    aws amplify

    push to git --> auto deploy
    preview deployment
    env variables
    auto ssl



api

    rest
    graphqql
    grpc
    websockets
    edge functions

    api get
        rate limits
        caching layers
        type safety
        schemes
        auto gent docs
