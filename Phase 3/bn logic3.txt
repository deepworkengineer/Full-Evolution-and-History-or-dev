backend stop being chaos and become real engineering
frameworks like Django, Rails, Lavaral show up and save developers from emotional breakdowns
they bring:
    routing (clean URL)
    MVC (Proper structure)
    templating system
    ORM (no raw SQL everywhere)
    Migration (versioned DB Changes)
    Easy auth
    JSON API (frontend can use them)
this is when backend become organized, predictable, and u could finally show your code to other humans without shame

routing: URL stop being tied to files
    old days (phase 2)
    profile.php?id=23
    u literally had a file for each page . 
    phase 3:
    /users/23
    the url is just a pattern and a router says:
        when someone visit this URL, run this controller function
    clean, organized no more 1000 .php files
