websites suddenly become planet - sized

fb hits 1 billions users
twitter is spewing millions of posts per hour

SQL alone cant handle

    billions of logs
    real time feeds
    flexible schemas
    weird JSON like social data
    massive write traffic

NoSQL =  databases that:

    dont use tables
    dont use schemas
    dont need joins
    can scale horizontally like beasts

MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra become the new toys


SQL evolves:
    btter indexes
    better replication
    better concurracy
    better performance



fb is a social graph
everything is a relationship

the socail graph shape looks like:

you cannot easily store this in normal SQL at FB scale
