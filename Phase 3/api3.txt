APIs finally become simple and clean

    JSON becomes the standard
    small, clean, easy for JS

    REST becomes the rule
    GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

    OAuth lets you log in using GOOLE / FB
    CORS allows browsers to call APIs safety

    Mobile apps and websites all use the same API

    think of it like normal conversation
    short sentences, clear meaning, easy to understand
