when u need multiple pages

    creates different pages:
        home feed page
        profile page
        search page
        post detial page

    make them switch WITHOUT page reload 


TOOLS you use:
    next.js ==== auto routing (each file = one page)
    react router ==== manual routing
    file structure creates routes automatically
