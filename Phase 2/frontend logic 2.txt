javascript arrives. the dom arrives
the browser now has a heartbeat, even if its one weak neuron

you finally get:
    functions
    variables
    events
    DOM manipulation
    basic state changes




DOM --- tree of objects

<h1>Hello</h1>
browser converts into:
    document
    |____ <html>
            |---- <body>
                    |--- <h1>
                          |--- "Hello"




selecting elements

this was the era before fancy APIs. you mostly used:
document.getElementById("id")
document.getElementsByTagName("div")
document.getElementsByClassName("btn")





Event logic:

early js logic was honestly baby level:
    * user clicks button --> run functions
    * user types something --> run function
    * user submit form ----> run function





Form Validation:

this is where JS actually become useful





show / hide elements

fancy stuff in 1998





changing styles

element.style.color = "red"
element.style.background = "yellow"





basic animations

this era invented painful manual animations
people used this to make menues slides down like they are drunk
