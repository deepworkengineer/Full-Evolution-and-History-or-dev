servers got a bigger team
one server did everything
now the job got split


Nginx sits in front handles incoming traffic
app servers (node, django, rails) run actual logic
database stores data
redis caches stuff
websockets let you do real time chat
load balancers distribute traffic
api replace full page reloads

this is where websites become apps
