after ui looks good, make it DO things

and the brain to your components

    when user clicks "like" heart forms red
    when user types comment, it shows charactter count
    when user scrolls, load more posts

tools u user:
    react users
    typescript
    custom functions

what u create
    functions like handleLike(), handleComment(), loadMorePosts()
