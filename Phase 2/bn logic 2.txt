severs finally grow neurons

languages like PHP and ASP ========= suddenly the server can think a little

servers can now:
    handle forms
    check username / password
    pull stuff from database
    generate HTML on the fly
    track users with session / cookies

every file had HTML + LOGIC mashed together like bad noodles
