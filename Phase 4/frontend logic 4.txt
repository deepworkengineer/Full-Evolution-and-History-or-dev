the 2006 kid! -- helper friend (jquery)

i want to add a toy truck
    tell your friend "find a wall"
    tell your friend "draw a truck"
    tell your friend "put it next to the cat"

still manual, but now you have a helper! but u still tell them every tiny step




2010 kid -- walkie talkie (backbone)


when i add a toy, tell the wall to update!

like playing with walkie talkie
i got a new truck! over
friend with walkie - talkie roger! drawing it now! over



2010 kid - magic mirror (angular)

you have a magic mirror on the wall!

whatever u write in your notebook appears on the mirror automatically!

how it works:
    mirrors checks your notebook every second
    did anything change? Did anything change?
    OH!  a new toy! let me draw it

mirror gets tired checking 1000 times per second




2019 kid --- recipe card (react)

u have recipe cards that tell you what the picture should look lik3


look at toy list --> draw picture of each toy
toys = ['cars', 'ball', 'truck']


check recipe (state)
bake entire batch (render)
if recipe changes ---> bake new batch

but react is smart it redraw only what changed (secretly compares old vs new)

your crayons are ALIVE

each crayon knows its job
