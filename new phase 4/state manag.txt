remembering stuff

when data needs to be shared everywhere

u need to remember:
    is user logged in?
    what in thier cart
    their theme preference
    current posts loaded

this data needs to be availbale everywhere in your app

tools:
    usestate = for simple local stuff
    zustand = for global app state
    react query = for server data 

what u create:
    central store that remembers
        current user
        all loaded posts
        app settings


like your brain remembering things. Your app needs memory tool State = app memory
